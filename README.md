# CS510-Fall2015-Final
The repository contains files to visualize the julimap and mandelbrot data points. The following is the structure of the directories and breif description of the files.

C-Juliaset : This directory contains all the programs that used to generate datapoints required for juliamap visualization

    Makefile :  The file has instructions to compile all the c programs in this directory
    complex.c : The definition of the functions that can be run on complex elements
    complex.h : The header file for the complex.c program
    complex.o : The object file ( loaded at runtime) for the complex.c program
    cplane.c :  The defintion for the plane ( 2D structure used to store complex numbers)
    cplane.h :  The header for the cplane.c program
    cplane.o :  The object file (loaded at runtime) for the cplane.c program
    julia :     The main executable program that generate datapoints for the juliamap visualization
    julia.c :   The defination of the functions that generates data points for julimap visualization
    julia.o :   The object file ( loaded at runtime) for the julia.c program
    juliaset.csv : The csv file that is generated by a sample run of the julia program

Cpp-Mandelbrot : This directory contains all the programs that used to generate datapoints required for mandelbrot visualization

    Makefile :    The file has instructions to compile all the c++ programs in this directory
    cplane.cpp :  The defintion for the plane ( 2D structure used to store complex numbers)
    cplane.hpp :  The header file for the cplane.cpp program
    cplane.o :    The object file ( loaded at runtime) for the cplane.cpp program
    julia.cpp :   The defintion for functions (e.g julimap) that can be peformed on complex numbers
    julia.h :     The header for the julia.cpp program
    julia.o:      The object file (loaded at runtime) for the julia.cpp program
    mandelbrot :  The main executable program that generate datapoints for the mandelbrot visualization
    mandelbrot.cpp: The defination of the functions that generates data points for mandelbrot visualization
    mandelbrot.csv: The csv file that is generated by a sample run of the mandelbrot program
    mandelbrot.o :  The object file ( loaded at runtime) for the mandelbrot.cpp program
    
Datasets : This directory contains the visualizations generated in the pdf format. 

    juliaset.pdf :    This is the visualzation file for the julimap dataset
    mandelbrot.pdf :  This is the visualization file for the mandelbrot dataset
    data.md :  This is markdown file that explains at a high level the visualizations
    
generate_output.sh : This program is used to generate the data points using the julia and mandelbrot executables

plotdata.py : This program is to used the generate the visualizations in a pdf format based on the data points provided to the input file

README.md : The readme document for this repository
